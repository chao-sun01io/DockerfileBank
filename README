# DockerfileBank

This repo stores my favorite docker image configuration, aka Dockerfile as development environments.



## Build docker image 

```sh
docker buildx build --load -t example_image .
```

Replace the `<image_name>` as you like.
Some useful options:

- `--platform linux/arm64` I use this to build a arm-linux image to run on my MacbookPro M1 (with arm SoC)


## Run docker container

```sh
docker run -it -v $(pwd):/workspace bank_base:latest
```
